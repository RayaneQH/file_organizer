Hello, This is my second big project that I will share with you 
This project is about orgnaizing files in a given directory, So tha it check all files in the directory and make categories folders and inside every category folder there are subfolder which are the types folder.
Example:                             directory
                                    /     |    \
                                   /      |     \
                                  /       |      \
                                 /        |       \
                                /         |        \
                            documents   videos      Images
                           /   |          |            |   \
                          /    |          |            |    \
                         /     |          |            |     \
                        /      |          |            |      \
                      txt      pdf       webm         PNG     GIF
                    /  |       |          |            |       | \
                   /   |       |          |            |       |  \
                  /    |       |          |            |       |   \
                 /     |       |          |            |       |    \
               file1   file2   file3    video         img     img   img
there will be another categories and types for sure , it's hard to visulize that .
this is the start date (2023-08-05 18:58). I am now write the plan for the project and that's it.
